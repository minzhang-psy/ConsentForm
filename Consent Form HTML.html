<div>You are invited to participate in a research study conducted by Dr. Ulrich Mayr of the Department of
    Psychology from the University of Oregon. This study is funded by the National Institutes of Health. In our
    study we hope to learn about the processes involved in the regulation of thought and action. Thank you for
    considering participating in this experiment.
    If you decide to participate, you will be performing simple tasks on the computer.   They involve
    speaking words, pressing keys, and/or touching a touch-sensitive screen in response to objects or words
    appearing on the monitor. In addition, eye-tracking equipment may be used to record your eye movements
    while performing the task, and/or a measurement device in form of a belt around your torso to assess your
    breathing rhythm. The procedure involves minimal risk of discomfort or stress. </div>

    </p>
    <p>You can discontinue participation at any time during the experiment. If you discontinue participation in
    the middle of the study, you will receive ¼ credit for each 15 minutes of participation, rounded up to the
    next 15 minutes. For example, if you complete 1-15 minutes you will receive ¼ credit, if you complete 16-
    30 minutes you will receive ½ credit, and so on. If you keep your scheduled appointment but choose not
    to participate in the study at all, you will still receive ¼ credit.
    </p>
<div>In this study, you will receive:</div>
    <input type="checkbox" id="creditsonly" name="creditsonly" value="Hourly Credit Only">
    <label for="creditsonly"> Hourly credit only</label><br>
    <input type="checkbox" id="credits&in" name="credits&in" value="Hourly credit + Extra incentives">
    <label for="credits&in"> Hourly credit + Extra incentives</label><div>In addition to the hourly credit, participants will receive small rewards for
        correct answers, in the form of money (to yourself or to charity), food, or images. Reward compensation will be
        linked to random trial numbers and will result in the addition of 1-50 cents per correct trial for monetary
        incentives. Because you will not know which trials are linked to rewards it is important that you do your best on
        each one. The amount of each reward will be randomly determined by the computer, with the total appearing on
        the final screen.</div>
        <p>By participating you help us to understand the basic mechanisms involved in the control of thought and
            action.  By understanding such basic processes, we are in a better position to help people overcoming unwanted,
            automatic thoughts.   However, we cannot guarantee that you personally will receive any benefits from this
            research.</p>  
            <p> 
            No information that is obtained in connection with this study will be identified with you.   Your
            confidentiality will be assured by associating your data with a code and a number specifying the experimental
            conditions that you are in, instead of with your name. 
            </p>
            <p>
            Your participation is voluntary.  Your decision whether or not to participate will not affect your 
            relationship with the UO Psychology Department or the UO Linguistics Department. If you decide to 
            participate, you are free to withdraw your consent and discontinue participating at any time without 
            penalty.  The Psychology and Linguistics Departments have established alternative assignments for 
            students who do not wish to participate as research subjects.  Please see your instructor if you would 
            rather complete an alternative assignment. 
            </p>
            <p>
            In addition, if your participation was solicited through a health care provider, your participation in this 
            research study is completely independent of diagnostic activities, treatment, or support you receive by the health
            care provider.  No information about your participation in the study (including, whether or not you participated)
            will be revealed to the health care provider.</p>
            <p>Please be aware that the principal investigator for this study has a financial interest in Cogmetric LLC, a
                company that develops cognitive testing systems. The current research you are participating in is not related to
                Cogmetric, but results from this research may inform work at Cogmetric in the future.
